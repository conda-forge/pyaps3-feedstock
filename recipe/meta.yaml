  summary: Python based Atmospheric Phase Screen estimation
  description: |
    This python 3 module estimates differential phase delay maps due to the
    stratified atmosphere for correcting radar interferograms. It is rewritten
    in Python 3 language from PYAPS source code and adapted for ECMWF's
